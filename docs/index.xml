      <description>At our core, we are storytellers driven by a passion for pushing the boundaries of interactive narratives. We explore both time-tested procedural design and cutting-edge advances in AI to craft experiences where player choices truly shape the story. Our mission is to reimagine what games can be—immersive, emotionally engaging, and deeply personal—and to make them accessible to everyone, regardless of their gaming background. Whether through visual novels, mystery adventures, or co-op storytelling experiences, we aim to bring the magic of interactive fiction to more people and platforms than ever before.</description>
